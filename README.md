Just seeing where this rabbit hole clicked me into..........
is it true that u can develop apps without knowing how to do any coding? if so.......
are these apps any good? what are they like? can you tell the difference between an app made by someone that knows coding vs.
someone that doesnt? if so.....How big a difference?
what apps have been developed by individuals not knowing how to code?
